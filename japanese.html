                    <li>1 cup Cake Flour</li>
                    <li>1 large Egg Yolk</li>

                    <li>Prepare Shrimp: Make small incisions on the belly side of the shrimp to prevent them from curling. Pat dry.</li>
                    <li>Heat Oil: Heat oil in a deep pot to 175°C / 350°F.</li>
                    <li>Make Batter: In a bowl, lightly whisk the egg yolk and ice-cold water. Add the cake flour and mix *very lightly*. Lumps are perfectly fine and essential for a crispy texture. Do not overmix.</li>
                    <li>Fry: Lightly dust the shrimp with flour, then dip into the batter, letting excess drip off.</li>
                    <li>Carefully slide the shrimp into the hot oil. Fry for 2-3 minutes, or until light golden and crispy. Do not overcrowd the pot.</li>
